\n \section capioverview C API Overview

See <a href="https://github.com/UltraMessaging/lbmct">https://github.com/UltraMessaging/lbmct</a> for code and
documentation.

The "lbmct" package is an API wrapper around the Ultra Messaging library which
adds the concept of end-to-end connectedness to UM's normal pub/sub messaging
model.
These "Connected Topics" (CTs) help Publisher and Subscriber applications
keep track of each other.

See \ref overview for user manual.
This API reference assumes familiarity with the information in that documentation.
