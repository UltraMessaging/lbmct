\n \section javaapioverview Java API Overview

See <a href="https://github.com/UltraMessaging/lbmct">https://github.com/UltraMessaging/lbmct</a> for code and
documentation.

The "lbmct" package is an API wrapper around the Ultra Messaging library which
adds the concept of end-to-end connectedness to UM's normal pub/sub messaging
model.
These "Connected Topics" (CTs) help Publisher and Subscriber applications
keep track of each other.

See \ref overview for user manual.
This API reference assumes familiarity with the information in that documentation.

The main classes of the public API are:
<ul>
<li>\ref com.latencybusters.lbmct.LbmCt - an "instance" of the connected topics wrapper.  Can contain any number of CT sources and receivers.
</li>
<li>\ref com.latencybusters.lbmct.LbmCtSrc - a connected receiver, associated with a UM topic.
</li>
<li>\ref com.latencybusters.lbmct.LbmCtRcv - a connected source, associated with a UM topic.
</li>
</ul>

Supporting classes are:
<ul>
<li>\ref com.latencybusters.lbmct.LbmCtConfig - configure the CT wrapper.
</li>
<li>\ref com.latencybusters.lbmct.LbmCtPeerInfo - holds information about the source and receiver applications.
</li>
<li>\ref com.latencybusters.lbmct.LbmCtRcvConn - minor class provided to give access to some additional information.
</li>
</ul>
