# lbmct v0.6 README - Connected Topics for Ultra Messaging

## LBMCT IS IN TRANSITION

As part of creating a Java version of connected topics, the github repo is in
a state of transition.
The C and Java version do not interoperate at this time.
The C version will be updated to conform to changes made to the wire protocol.

Also, some changes will be made to the C API which will be incompatible with
the existing (0.5) version of the API.

## REPOSITORY

See https://github.com/UltraMessaging/lbmct for code and documentation.
